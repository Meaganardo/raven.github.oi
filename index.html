			<h1> ~ How We Began ~</h1>
			<h2 style="color:white"> The Black Raven, whom we look to for guidance, has been of our world since before the records of history were able to be written. It is believed that the origins of the Raven came after the fall in the Garden of Eden. Only then did the Raven take flight from the confines of the garden and was able to explore the world freely.</h2>
			<h2 style="color:white"> Because of its bravery and vigor, the Raven given the gift of foresight and many other worldly powers we as humans cannot comprehend and us as followers do not question. The Ravenâ€™s spirit came to serve under the deep spirit of the Wendigo for some time. The Raven, after centuries of serving under an unjust spirit, split itself from the shackles of the Wendigo and flew free once more.</h2>
			<h2 style="color:white"> The Raven after splitting from the Wendigo found itself amidst a human by the name of Oberon Iagoson. Seeing this human in misfortune he took pity on Oberon, and granted him fortune and wellbeing. Oberon in thanksgiving to this freeing savior in turn began the Order of the Black Raven so others may know the power of this giving spirit and to serve it.</h2>
			<h2 style="color:white"> We are now still strong in our servitude to the great Black Raven as its powers bring all who serve it  and follow its rules fortune and favor to their lives. </h2>

It was not but a few months that he was gone when he received a letter form his village with terrible news. A house fire int he nigh had consumed his families home and with it, his family. Oberon returned to his village immediately only to find there was nothing left of his home or his family. Crushed with the weight of all he had lost, a Raven descended downside him. But what Oberon saw was no ordinary raven, but a being that was unable to be described in words. The Sprit took pity on Oberon and gave him gifts and a new home to help with eh loss of all he had. The raven ins rucked him to build a new family around him and that it will all flourish. There will be no more loss if Oberon kept to his rituals like he was instructed and respected his Patron. And Oberon did just that. And from the ashes of his home came a new order and family, of the Black Raven. </h2>

			<p>The Black Raven binds us to each other and our destinies.</p>
			<p> For it is all knowing and all powerful, it sees all.</p>
			<p> We all are of One family from the same tree.</p>
			<p> Our branches reach out for all to shelter in.<p>
			<p> The darkness is not to be feared but just a vale over the good works. </p>
			<p> Black is not a mournful color but a reminder of beauty that is hidden in night.</p>
			<p> Claws are careful tools for friendship and protection. </p>
			<p>Death is it not to be feared but embraced, for the final flight of one's soul. </p>
